<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1:<br>
Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.</li>
<li>Example 2:<br>
Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</li>
<li>Example 3:<br>
Input: x = 10<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1<br>
<h3>Follow up</h3>
<p>Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?</p>
